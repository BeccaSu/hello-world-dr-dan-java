# Hello World w/ Dr. Dan - A Complete Introduction to Programming from Java to C++ (hello-world-dr-dan-java)
An in-depth beginner's walk-through, taught by [Dr. Dan Grissom](http://www.dangrissom.com), of the Java programming language with a transition into (and intro to) C++. Video tutorials of this code being written from scratch and being explained in-depth can be found at [hellodrdan.com](http://www.hellodrdan.com) (coming soon).

# Syllabus
This course is taught in 8 modules and mimics the education you'd obtain if you sat through an entire year of introductory programming at the university level. I've taught intro-level programming for 6+ years and am accutely aware of what beginners need to see and hear. In short, **I DON'T SKIP STEPS!**.

## Module 1 - Basics
Module 1 covers the basics of programming, specifically with the Java programming language. The content in this section is almost always taught in a "101"-style intro programming course. A wide variety of concepts are covered, but the high-level topics and goals of this module are:
1. Printing to Console & Basic Variables
2. Primitive Data Types
3. Strings and Parsing
4. Boolean Logic (relational operators, unary operators, conditional operators)
5. Conditional Logic and Basic Math (math operators, short-hand operators, incrementors)
6. Loops (for, while, do while)
7. More Loop Practice (String and Character methods, ASCII)
8. Basic Statistics (more loop practice, average, min, max, sum)

## Module 2 - Functions and Storage
Module 2 covers the intermediate topics of programming (in Java), specifically focusing on functions (methods) and storage (arrays and ArrayLists). The content in this section is almost always taught in a "101"-style intro programming course, although ArrayLists are sometimes taught at the beginning of a "102"-style intro programming course. A wide variety of concepts are covered, but the high-level topics and goals of this module are:
1. Functions (pass by value and static functions)
2. Single-Dimension (1D) Arrays and the Random Class (declaring, initializing and iterating)
3. Counting Arrays
4. 2D Arrays (declaring, initializing, iterating and processing)
5. More Array Practice (cards shuffling example)
6. Functions (pass by reference)
7. ArrayLists (declaring, methods, iterating, sorting, nesting)
8. More 2D-Array and ArrayList Practice (cards shuffling example)
